- Signing up with ***[Open Street Map Organization](https://www.openstreetmap.org/ "OpenStreetMap")*** and joining the community gets one ready to start contributing to the OSM by digitizing some map features 

### Open Street Map

1. OpenStreetMap is a free, open geographic database updated and maintained by a community of volunteers via open collaboration. Contributors collect data from surveys, trace from aerial imagery and also import from other freely licensed geodata sources.
2. Login to account / Sign Up to the Open Street Map organization for an Account 
3. Use search bar to navigate to AOI.
4. You can edit the Map with iD (in-browser editor) or Remote Control (JOSM, Potlatch, Merkaartor) 
5. If editing polygons, choose area and trace the boundaries and add a tag. Insert ‘Yes’ if you do not know what 
kind of building the digitised building is, otherwise select from the drop down.
6. Save your work every 10 to 20 edits with a meaningful comment.

### Reference : [GIS COP 21/06/2022 Open Street Map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mik1yMsxbqI&t=148s 'OSM GIS COP')

- Edit the OSM by:

# Week 3

## Computer Hardware n Software

### Reference : [Computer Firmware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895 "Computer Hardware n Software")

Computer hardware refers to the _physical_ components that make up a computer system
There are many different kinds of hardware that can be installed inside, and connected to the outside, of a computer
Computer hardware may sometimes be seen abbreviated as _computer hw_

### List of Computer Hardware

[List of Computer Hardware](computerHardware.md "List of Computer Hardware")

### Hardware vs Software

- A computer system isn't complete unless there's also software, which is different than hardware. The software is data that's stored electronically, like an operating system or a video editing tool, which _runs on the hardware_
- Hardware gets its name due to the fact that it's strict when it comes to modifications, whereas software is more flexible (i.e., you can easily upgrade or change software)
- Firmware is closely related to hardware and software, too. Firmware is used to tie the two together so that a software program knows how to interface with a piece of hardware

### Reference : [Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers explained for Developers](https://www.theserverside.com/tip/Binary-and-hexadecimal-numbers-explained-for-developers 'Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers')

### Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers

[Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers](binaryHexadecimalNumbers.md 'Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers')

*Hex and Binary in Action*

- What's especially interesting about hexadecimal and binary notation is that a hex value simplifies the expression of the value of bytes. Any eight bits in a byte becomes either a one-digit or two-digit hexadecimal numeral.

- For example, a byte with four bits off and four bits on is expressed in binary as 00001111, and converts to f in hexadecimal, while byte of eight bits "on" is 11111111 in binary and ff in hexadecimal.

- Using hexadecimal numerals to express the value of a byte is a powerful technique. For example, engineers who work with serialization formats such as Protocol Buffers and Apache Thrift at the byte level use hexadecimal numbers all the time. When programmers work with the actual bits that those bytes represent, they will use binary notation.

- The ability to interpret and convert binary and hexadecimal number systems is a good tool to have in the toolbox of any DevOps developer. You might not be at the bit and byte level today, but as the scope of computing activities for all types of developers continues to broaden, one day you might.

### Frequently Asked Questions

1. **What are the four main types of computer hardware?** ~ The four primary categories of computer hardware include input devices, output devices, processing devices, and storage devices.
2. **How do you clean your computer hardware?** ~ Learn how to clean your PC to help extend its life and make it run more efficiently. Always unplug computers prior to cleaning, and only use recommended materials such as lint-free cloths, canned air, and carefully applied isopropyl alcohol.
