# Week 3

## Computer Hardware n Software

### Reference : [Computer Firmware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895 "Computer Hardware n Software")

Computer hardware refers to the _physical_ components that make up a computer system
There are many different kinds of hardware that can be installed inside, and connected to the outside, of a computer
Computer hardware may sometimes be seen abbreviated as _computer hw_

### List of Computer Hardware

[List of Computer Hardware](computerHardware.md "List of Computer Hardware")

### Hardware vs Software

- A computer system isn't complete unless there's also software, which is different than hardware. The software is data that's stored electronically, like an operating system or a video editing tool, which _runs on the hardware_
- Hardware gets its name due to the fact that it's strict when it comes to modifications, whereas software is more flexible (i.e., you can easily upgrade or change software)
- Firmware is closely related to hardware and software, too. Firmware is used to tie the two together so that a software program knows how to interface with a piece of hardware

### Reference : [Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers explained for Developers](https://www.theserverside.com/tip/Binary-and-hexadecimal-numbers-explained-for-developers 'Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers')

### Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers

[Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers](binaryHexadecimalNumbers.md 'Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers')

*Hex and Binary in Action*

- What's especially interesting about hexadecimal and binary notation is that a hex value simplifies the expression of the value of bytes. Any eight bits in a byte becomes either a one-digit or two-digit hexadecimal numeral.

- For example, a byte with four bits off and four bits on is expressed in binary as 00001111, and converts to f in hexadecimal, while byte of eight bits "on" is 11111111 in binary and ff in hexadecimal.

- Using hexadecimal numerals to express the value of a byte is a powerful technique. For example, engineers who work with serialization formats such as Protocol Buffers and Apache Thrift at the byte level use hexadecimal numbers all the time. When programmers work with the actual bits that those bytes represent, they will use binary notation.

- The ability to interpret and convert binary and hexadecimal number systems is a good tool to have in the toolbox of any DevOps developer. You might not be at the bit and byte level today, but as the scope of computing activities for all types of developers continues to broaden, one day you might.

### Frequently Asked Questions

1. **What are the four main types of computer hardware?** ~ The four primary categories of computer hardware include input devices, output devices, processing devices, and storage devices.
2. **How do you clean your computer hardware?** ~ Learn how to clean your PC to help extend its life and make it run more efficiently. Always unplug computers prior to cleaning, and only use recommended materials such as lint-free cloths, canned air, and carefully applied isopropyl alcohol.

Difference | c.difference(d) | {7} | 7 is the difference

### Dictionary

a). **Error Handling**

### Reference : [Python Error Handling](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html 'Error Handling Techniques')

**Types of Errors**

PythonError | Description
----- | -----------
ValueError | An exception that occurs when a function receives an argument of the correct data type but an inappropriate value. This error usually occurs in mathematical operations that require a certain kind of value.
SyntaxError | An error in the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed structured statements and sentences in a particular coding language or programming language, entered by a programmer. For compiled languages, syntax errors are detected at compile-time. A program will not compile until all syntax errors are corrected.
TypeError | An exception that occurs when the data type of an object in an operation is inappropriate. This can happen when an operation is performed on an object of an incorrect type, or it is not supported for the object.
ConnectionError | This will be raised, if there is any connection error. For example, the network failed, Domain Name System error so the Request library will raise ConnectionError exception.
ZeroDivisionError | A built-in Python exception thrown when a number is divided by 0.
NameError | It occurs when you try to use a variable, function, or module that doesn't exist or wasn't used in a valid way. 
RuntimeError | A type of error that occurs during program execution. The Python interpreter executes a script if it is syntactically correct. However, if it encounters an issue at runtime, which is not detected when the script is parsed, script execution may halt unexpectedly.
FileNotFoundError | It indicates that Python cannot find the file you are referencing. Python raises this error because your program cannot continue running without being able to access the file to which your program refers.

- a _try_ statement is used to handle an exception. The _try_ block lets one test a block of code for errors.
- an _except_ block lets one handle an error.
- a _finally_ statement always executes whether exceptions occurred or not. The finally block lets one execute code, regardless of the result of the try and except blocks.
- an _else_ clause only executes when the _try_ clause terminates normally. The _else_ clause is valid only if the _try_ statement has at least one _except_ clause. The _else_ block lets one execute code when there is no error.

b). **File Handling**

- The key function for working with files in Python is the open() function.
- The open() function takes two parameters; *filename*, and *mode*.
- *filename*: gives name of the file that the file object has opened.
- *mode*: attribute of a file object tells you which mode a file was opened in.

**File Modes in Python**

Mode | Description
---- | -----------
‘r’ | This is the default mode. It opens file for reading. It returns an error if the file does not exist.
‘w’	| This mode opens file for writing. If file does not exist, it creates a new file. If file exists it truncates the file.
‘x’ | Creates a new file. If file already exists, it returns an error thus the operation fails.
‘a’ | Open file in append mode. If file does not exist, it creates a new file.
‘t’ | This is the default mode. It opens in text mode.
‘b’ | This opens in binary mode. E.g. Images
‘+’ | This will open a file for reading and writing (updating)

### Object Oriented Programming

#### Classes 

***Definition:*** A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them. In python a class is created by the keyword class. An object is created using the constructor of the class. This object will then be called the instance of the class.

#### Libraries 

***Definition:*** A library is a collection of utility methods, classes, and modules that your application code can use to perform specific tasks without writing the functionalities from scratch. It contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. It makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the Programmer.

Examples of Python libraries:

1. Django
2. SciPy
3. Pandas
4. NumPy
5. TensorFlow
6. PyTorch

# Week 6

## PostgreSQL 'n' PostGIS

### Database

***Definition*** - According to *Wikipedia* a database consists of an organized collection of data for one or more uses, accessed electronically typically in digital form. Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage.

### Relational or Structured Query Language Database

***Definition*** - A collection of highly structured tables, wherein each row reflects a data entity, and every column defines a specific information field. Relational databases are built using the structured query language (SQL) to create, store, update, and retrieve data.

### Database Management System

***Definition*** - According to *Wikipedia* a database management system (DBMS) consists of software that operates databases, providing storage, access, security, backup and other facilities. It is a data-keeping system with facilities to perform several kinds of operations on a system such as manipulation of the data in the database or the management of the database structure itself.

### Tables or Structured Query Language Relation

***Definition*** - It is a set of data elements (field values) that is organized using a model of vertical columns and horizontal rows. A table has a specified number of columns, but can have any number of rows. 

 id | name  | age
 -- | ----  | ---
  1 | Ashleigh | 23
  2 | Aaron | 24
  
(2 rows by 3 columns table)

### Columns or Fields

***Definition*** - It is a set of data values of a particular simple type, one for each row of the table. A field (aka field value) refers specifically to the single item that exists at the intersection between one row and one column.

A Field ↧

| name |
| ---- |
| Ashleigh |
| Manyanye |  

A Field Value ↧

| Manyanye |
| :------: |

### Records

***Definition*** - It is the information stored in a table row. One record is shown here ↧  

|  2  |  Aaron  |  24  |
| :-- |  :---:  | ---: |

### Datatypes

- The type of information stored in each column is its datatype.

Datatype | Description
-------- | -----------
String | To store free-form text data
Integer | To store whole numbers
Real | To store decimal numbers
Date | To store dates
Boolean | To store simple true/false values

- If the field is empty, then the field value is referred to as a ‘null’ value.

### Normalisation

***Definition*** - The process of removing redundancy or data duplicacy from a database. According to *Wikipedia* - It is a systematic way of ensuring that a database structure is suitable for general-purpose querying and free of certain undesirable characteristics - insertion, update, and deletion anomalies - that could lead to a loss of data integrity.

### Indexes

***Definition*** - It is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table.

### Sequences 

***Definition*** - It is a unique number generator. It is normally used to create a unique identifier for a column in a table.

### Constraint 

***Definition*** - A database constraint is used to ensure that data in a relation matches the modeller’s view of how that data should be stored. 

### Primary Key

***Definition*** - A primary key is one or more field values that make a record unique. Usually the primary key is called id and is a sequence.

### Foreign Key

***Definition*** - A foreign key is used to refer to a unique record on another table (using that other table’s primary key).

### Entity Relationship Diagramming

***Definition*** - The entity-relationship diagram (ER Diagram) is used to design the logical dependencies between the relations. In ER Diagramming, the linkage between tables is normally based on Foreign keys linking to primary keys.

### Transactions

***Definition*** - They allow one to create a rollback position where one can return to if the modifications to the database did not run as planned.



#### PostgreSQL 

***Definition*** - PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance. < - Wikipedia

| Task | Syntax | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| how to create a table | ```create table streets (id serial not null primary key, name varchar(50));``` | serial and varchar are data types. serial tells PostgreSQL to start an integer sequence (auto-number) to populate the id automatically for every new record whereas varchar(50) tells PostgreSQL to create a character field of 50 characters in length. all SQL commands terminate with a semi-colon ( ; ). |

## ERDs

### Reference : [ERD](https://creately.com/guides/er-diagrams-tutorial/ 'Entity Relationship Diagrams')

***Definition*** - An Entity Relationship Diagram _(ERD)_ is a visual representation of different entities within a system and how they relate to each other

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) Symbols and Notations

![Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) Symbols and Notations](/pics/Entity%20Relationship%20Diagram%20(ERD)%20Symbols%20and%20Notations.webp  "Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) Symbols and Notations")

- There are three basic elements in an ER Diagram: entity, attribute, relationship. There are more elements which are based on the main elements. They are weak entity, multi valued attribute, derived attribute, weak relationship, and recursive relationship. Cardinality and ordinality are two other notations used in ER diagrams to further define relationships.

### ER Models in Database Design

- They are widely used to design relational databases. The entities in the ER schema become tables, attributes and converted the database schema. Since they can be used to visualize database tables and their relationship, it’s commonly used for database troubleshooting as well.

### Entity Relationship Diagrams in Software Engineering

- Entity relationship diagrams are used in software engineering during the planning stages of the software project. They help to identify different system elements and their relationships with each other. It is often used as the basis for data flow diagrams or DFD’s as they are commonly known.
- For example, an inventory software used in a retail shop will have a database that monitors elements such as purchases, item, item type, item source and item price. Rendering this information through an ER diagram would be something like this: 

![Entity Relationship Diagrams in Software Engineering](/pics/Entity%20Relationship%20Diagrams%20in%20Software%20Engineering.webp "Entity Relationship Diagrams in Software Engineering") 

| Element | Description | Image |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Entity | An entity can be a person, place, event, or object that is relevant to a given system. For example, a school system may include students, teachers, major courses, subjects, fees, and other items. Entities are represented in ER diagrams by a rectangle and named using singular nouns. | ![Entity](/pics/Entity.webp  "Entity") |  
| Weak Entity | A weak entity is an entity that depends on the existence of another entity. In more technical terms it can be defined as an entity that cannot be identified by its own attributes. It uses a foreign key combined with its attributed to form the primary key. An entity like order item is a good example for this. The order item will be meaningless without an order so it depends on the existence of the order. | ![Weak Entity](/pics/Weak%20Entity.webp  "Weak Entity") |
| Attribute | An attribute is a property, trait, or characteristic of an entity, relationship, or another attribute. For example, the attribute Inventory Item Name is an attribute of the entity Inventory Item. An entity can have as many attributes as necessary. Meanwhile, attributes can also have their own specific attributes. For example, the attribute “customer address” can have the attributes number, street, city, and state. These are called composite attributes. Note that some top level ER diagrams do not show attributes for the sake of simplicity. In those that do, however, attributes are represented by oval shapes. | ![Attribute](/pics/Attribute.webp  "Attribute") |
| Multivalued Attribute | If an attribute can have more than one value it is called a multi valued attribute It is important to note that this is different from an attribute having its own attributes. For example, a teacher entity can have multiple subject values. | ![Multivalued Attribute](/pics/Multivalued%20Attribute.webp "Multivalued Attribute") |
| Derived Attribute | An attribute based on another attribute. This is found rarely in ER diagrams. For example, for a circle, the area can be derived from the radius. | ![Derived Attribute](/pics/Derived%20Attribute.webp "Derived Attribute") |
| Relationship | A relationship describes how entities interact. For example, the entity “Carpenter” may be related to the entity “table” by the relationship “builds” or “makes”. Relationships are represented by diamond shapes and are labeled using verbs. | ![Relationship](/pics/Relationship.webp "Relationship") |
| Recursive Relationship | If the same entity participates more than once in a relationship it is known as a recursive relationship. In the below example an employee can be a supervisor and be supervised, so there is a recursive relationship. | ![Recursive Relationship](/pics/Recursive%20Relationship.webp "Recursive Relationship") |
| Cardinality and Ordinality | These two further defines relationships between entities by placing the relationship in the context of numbers. In an email system, for example, one account can have multiple contacts. The relationship, in this case, follows a “one to many” model. There are a number of notations used to present cardinality in ER diagrams. Chen, UML, Crow’s foot, Bachman are some of the popular notations. Creately supports Chen, UML and Crow’s foot notations.The following example uses UML to show cardinality. | ![Cardinality and Ordinality](pics/Cardinality%20and%20Ordinality.webp "Cardinality and Ordinality") |

### How to Draw Entity Relationship Diagrams

1. ***Identify all the entities*** in the system. An entity should appear only once in a particular diagram. Create rectangles for all entities and name them properly.
2. ***Identify relationships*** between entities. Connect them using a line and add a diamond in the middle describing the relationship.
3. ***Add attributes*** for entities. Give meaningful attribute names so they can be understood easily. 

### ERD Best Practices

1. Provide a precise and appropriate name for each entity, attribute, and relationship in the diagram. Terms that are simple and familiar always beats vague, technical-sounding words. In naming entities, remember to use singular nouns. However, adjectives may be used to distinguish entities belonging to the same class (part-time employee and full-time employee, for example). Meanwhile attribute names must be meaningful, unique, system-independent, and easily understandable.
2. Remove vague, redundant or unnecessary relationships between entities.
3. Never connect a relationship to another relationship.
4. Make effective use of colors. You can use colors to classify similar entities or to highlight key areas in your diagrams.

| **Benefits of Entity Relationship Diagrams** |
| -------------------------------------------- |
| ER diagrams constitute a very useful framework for creating and manipulating databases. First, ER diagrams are easy to understand and do not require a person to undergo extensive training to be able to work with it efficiently and accurately. This means that designers can use ER diagrams to easily communicate with developers, customers, and end users, regardless of their IT proficiency. <br></br> Second, ER diagrams are readily translatable into relational tables which can be used to quickly build databases. In addition, ER diagrams can directly be used by database developers as the blueprint for implementing data in specific software applications. <br></br> Lastly, ER diagrams may be applied in other contexts such as describing the different relationships and operations within an organization. <br></br> |
