- Here are some common individual computer hardware components that you'll often find _inside_ a modern computer. These parts are almost always found inside the computer case, so you won't see them unless you open the computer:

1. Motherboard, System Board, & Mainboard
2. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
3. Random Access Memory (RAM)
4. Power Supply Unit (PSU)
5. Video card
6. Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
7. Solid-State Drive (SSD)
8. Optical disk drive (e.g., BD/DVD/CD drive)
9. Card reader (SD/SDHC, CF, etc.)

- Common hardware that you might find connected to the _outside_ of a computer, although many tablets, laptops, and netbooks integrate some of these items into their housings:

1. Monitor
2. Keyboard
3. Mouse
4. Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)
5. Flash drive
6. Printer
7. Speakers
8. External hard drive
9. Pen tablet

- Less common individual computer hardware devices, either because these pieces are now usually integrated into other devices or because they've been replaced with newer technology:

1. Sound card
2. Network Interface Card (NIC)
3. Expansion card (FireWire, USB, etc.)
4. Hard drive controller card
5. Analog modem
6. Scanner
7. Projector
8. Floppy disk drive
9. Joystick
10. Webcam
11. Microphone
12. Tape drive
13. Zip drive

- The following hardware is referred to as _â€‹network hardware,_ and various pieces are often part of a home or business network:

1. Digital modem (e.g., cable modem, DSL modem, etc.)
2. Router
3. Network switch
4. Access point
5. Repeater
6. Bridge
7. Print server
8. Firewall

- Network hardware isn't as clearly defined as some other types of computer hardware. For example, many home routers will often act as a combination router, switch, and firewall.

- In addition to all the items listed above, there's more computer hardware called _auxiliary hardware,_ of which a computer might have none, or several, of some kinds:

1. Fan (CPU, GPU, Case, etc.)
2. Heat sink
3. Data cable
4. Power cable
5. CMOS battery
6. Daughterboard

- Some of the devices listed above are called peripheral devices. A peripheral device is a piece of hardware (whether internal or external) that isn't actually involved in the computer's main function. Examples include a monitor, video card, disc drive, and mouse.
